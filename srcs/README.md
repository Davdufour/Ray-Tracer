This [Ray Tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) was created as a school project

Ray tracing is a rendering technique using 3d vectors to reproduce the reality effect of lights on shapes such as Sphere, Cylinder, Cones and Planes

We added the torus and triangle as complex shapes, with more time we could implement compatibility with .3ds or .pov file extension to create more detailed scenes

This program used OpenCL for parallel programming to accelerate the movement and the rendering speed

Project created on pure C with SDL (SDL2, SDL2_ttf & SDL2_image) & OpenCL

## Getting Started

On of our main objective was to create a smooth and responsive ray tracer, to reduce the rendering calculation through movement the image is pixelated

The final render is calculated when movement stops

### Prerequisites

All frameworks are included

Send me a notification if you find compatibility issues

## Installing

Install with

```
git clone https://github.com/armou/Ray_Tracer.git ~/RT
cd ~/RT
make
```

Start a scene

```
./rt scene/scene7.xml
```

Modify and play around with the scene files available in the Scene folder, you can even make your own !

Send me a notification if you find compatibility issues

### Clean

Clean your directory using the available commands

Delete object files

```
make clean
```

Delete binaries and libraries

```
make fclean
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The shortcut are essential to navigate in the scene and move objects

### Camera Controls

- <kbd>w</kbd> / <kbd>s</kbd> rotate camera up / down
- <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>d</kbd> rotate camera left / right
- <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> / <kbd>&darr;</kbd> move forward / backward
- <kbd>&larr;</kbd> / <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> move left / right
- <kbd>pageup</kbd> / <kbd>pagedown</kbd> move up / down
- <kbd>tab</kbd> reset to initial position

### Objects Controls

Select an object with `Left Click`. Unselect with `Right Click`

Object movement (arrows) and rotation (w/a/s/d) use the same controls as the camera

- <kbd>x</kbd> / <kbd>c</kbd> / <kbd>v</kbd> modify object color with r/g/b values
- <kbd>+</kbd> / <kbd>-</kbd> modify object size
- <kbd>f</kbd> change object texture (note that some textures are only available for specific object type e.g Sphere)
- <kbd>n</kbd> modify the intensity of normal variation for bump mapping
- <kbd>delete</kbd> delete object
- <kbd>z</kbd> print object informations on the terminal
- <kbd>i</kbd> add sphere (on current position)
- <kbd>u</kbd> add torus (on current position)
- <kbd>y</kbd> add plan (on current position)
- <kbd>t</kbd> add light (on current position)
- <kbd>r</kbd> add triangle (on current position)

### Options Controls

- <kbd>q</kbd> apply filter to the scene (sepia/negative/blue-saturated/grey/red/green/blue)
- <kbd>k</kbd> / <kbd>l</kbd> + / - antialiasing
- <kbd>o</kbd> save a render in `img/` folder
- <kbd>m</kbd> activate motion blur
- <kbd>n</kbd> increase bump mapping intensity (only on objects with bump mapping activated)
- <kbd>1</kbd> / <kbd>2</kbd> / <kbd>3</kbd> / <kbd>4</kbd> / <kbd>5</kbd> switch scene
